## What is this project trying to do?

What does the number of Federal Firearms Licenses in a given state say about that state? About the United States as a whole?

Can data provided by the ATF on Federal Firearms License holders - when compared to various datasets from the **US Census**, **American Community Survey**, and **Energy Information Administration** - provide insight into the nature of American populations?

# What is a Federal Firearms License?

In the United States, a Federal Firearms License (FFL) is a requirement for those who engage in the business of firearms - generally **dealers**, **manufacturers**, and **importers**. 

It's not actually a license to carry a firearm; it's strictly for conducting business involving firearms.

The ATF considers 9 __types__ of FFLs: 

- Dealer
- Pawnbroker
- Collector
- Manufacturer of Ammunition
- Manufacturer of Firearms
- Dealer in Destructive Devices
- Manufacturer of Destructive Devices
- Importer of Destructive Devices

This [data](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/listing-federal-firearms-licensees-ffls-2016) is published monthly. How have the counts changed from 1975 to 2015<sup>[2](#works-cited)</sup>?
